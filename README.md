# Project Java 
# Come to the Rescue of a Java Application

A project done as part of my Java application developper training (project nÂ°2).

The main skills acquired with this project were:
* understand the java programming language
* build a collaborative code project (using GitHub and the workflow Gitflow)

by correcting and and completing and existing project.
